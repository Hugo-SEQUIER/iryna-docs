# Character

**Note:** The `defaultCharacter.json` file is inspired by the one from ElizaOS. We chose this because it's easy to use and a lot of people are now familiar with it.

The `defaultCharacter.json` file defines the initial configuration for your agent. This JSON file includes details such as the agent's name, description, model integration settings, message examples, knowledge base, goals, and workflows. Here's a breakdown of its structure:

```json
