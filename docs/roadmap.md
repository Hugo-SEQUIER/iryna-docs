# Roadmap

## Q1 2025
- [X] Framework MVP

The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Iryna Framework is likely the initial version that includes core functionalities necessary for building intelligent agents. This framework aims to provide a versatile platform for interacting with Web3 technologies, as highlighted in docs/agents.md. The MVP would focus on establishing the basic infrastructure and features needed to support agent creation and management.

- [X] Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is essential for users to understand and effectively use the Iryna Framework

- [ ] Swarm MVP

The Swarm MVP involves the initial implementation of swarm intelligence within the framework. This feature allows multiple agents to collaborate and share knowledge, inspired by natural systems' collective behavior. The concept is detailed in <a href="/docs/swarm">Swarm section</a>, emphasizing decentralized task management and execution.

- [ ] Client MVP

The Client MVP likely refers to developing a user interface or application that interacts with the Iryna Framework. This client would enable users to engage with the system, define workflows, and manage agents, providing a bridge between the framework's backend capabilities and user interactions.

## Q2 2025
- [ ] Dynamic NFT Agent

The Dynamic NFT Agent involves integrating Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) with each agent, where the NFT's metadata can dynamically change. This feature would allow for the representation of an agent's state, achievements, or other attributes in a unique and verifiable way. The dynamic nature of the metadata means it can update based on the agent's interactions, performance, or other predefined criteria. This integration would enhance the personalization and traceability of agents within the Iryna Framework, providing a novel way to track and showcase agent evolution and capabilities.

- [ ] New AI provider (Claude, Ollama, Deepseek, etc.)

Integrating new AI providers into the framework would enhance the intelligence and capabilities of the agents. This could involve using advanced AI models for decision-making, data processing, or interaction with external services, broadening the framework's applicability.

- [ ] Plugins development / features

Developing plugins would allow for extending the framework's functionality, aligning with the modular and developer-friendly structure described in <a href="/docs/vision">Vision</a>. Plugins could introduce new features, integrations, or enhancements, enabling customization and scalability.

- [ ] Agent Marketplace

The Agent Marketplace would be a platform where different agents or their functionalities can be shared, sold, or exchanged. This marketplace would foster a decentralized ecosystem, encouraging innovation and collaboration among developers and users.

## Q3 2025

- [ ] Fully autonomous agent with TEE

Developing fully autonomous agents using Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) would enhance security and reliability. TEEs provide a secure area within a processor, ensuring that sensitive operations are protected from external threats, crucial for autonomous decision-making and execution.

- [ ] Builder Agent

A Builder Agent would be designed to assist in creating or configuring other agents or workflows. This agent could automate the setup process, making it easier for users to deploy and manage agents without extensive technical knowledge. Additionally, the Builder Agent could create new features and act on the code, further enhancing its utility and flexibility within the framework.

- [ ] No Code interface

A No Code interface would enable users to create new features or plugins from a client, allowing non-developers to easily add new functionalities. This feature would make the framework accessible to a broader audience by providing a user-friendly interface for extending the framework's capabilities.

## Q4 2025

- [ ] TBD

The goals for Q4 2025 are yet to be determined, allowing the team to adapt to new opportunities, challenges, or technological advancements that arise throughout the year. This flexibility ensures that the roadmap remains relevant and responsive to the evolving landscape.
