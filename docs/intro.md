2. **Technical Documentation**:
   The second part is a detailed, technical guide on how to use Trophē. It includes step-by-step instructions, code examples, and best practices for implementing and integrating our solution into your projects. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or technical user, this section will help you make the most of Trophē's capabilities.
