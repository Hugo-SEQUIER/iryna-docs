# Iryna Documentation

Welcome to the Iryna Documentation! This comprehensive guide is designed to provide you with all the information you need to understand and utilize our solution effectively. The documentation is divided into two main parts:

1. **Key Concept**: 

   This section introduces you to Iryna, explaining its purpose, key features, and the problems it aims to solve. It provides a high-level understanding of the project, its goals, and how it can benefit users.


2. **Technical Documentation**:
   The second part is a detailed, technical guide on how to use Iryna. It includes step-by-step instructions, code examples, and best practices for implementing and integrating our solution into your projects. Whether you're a developer, system administrator, or technical user, this section will help you make the most of Iryna's capabilities.


We recommend starting with the Key Concepts to gain a solid understanding of Iryna before diving into the technical details. Let's begin exploring Iryna and how it can enhance your workflow!
