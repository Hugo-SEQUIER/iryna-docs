# Team

## Meet the Founder

Hello! My name is <a href="https://linktr.ee/sequierh" target="_blank">Hugo SEQUIER</a>, a 23-year-old French student based in Paris. I am currently working as a Data Scientist apprentice in the construction industry. My passion for new technologies drives me to contribute to the ongoing revolution within this ever-evolving ecosystem.

## About Trophē

I am the sole contributor to the Trophē project, dedicating my time and efforts to bring my vision to life. As I continue to make significant progress towards my goals, I plan to expand the team. Once the project reaches a more advanced stage, I will be seeking passionate and skilled individuals to join me. This will help to accelerate our progress and ensure that Trophē evolves into a robust and innovative platform.

## My Journey

In 2021, I discovered cryptocurrencies from a builder's perspective through CryptoZombie, learning to use Solidity for smart contract development. However, I decided to set aside this pursuit and refocus on my studies and the field of AI to develop my skills and specialize in this area. This pivot was driven by the slow growth of the blockchain job market in France, making it challenging to find work-study opportunities in the field. Consequently, I chose to pursue a professional path in AI, a rapidly developing and highly attractive sector in France that aligns with my interests. I revisited blockchain technology in November 2023, adding a financial perspective to my understanding.

Since April 2024, I have been working on the Trophē project, merging my expertise in AI and blockchain to create innovative solutions. My enthusiasm for technology extends beyond AI and data science. I have a strong interest in blockchain technology, which I believe has immense potential to transform various sectors. Blockchain goes beyond cryptocurrencies; it offers robust solutions for securing transactions, ensuring data traceability, and creating decentralized computing networks, among other applications.

## Vision and Goals

I aim to democratize access to advanced technologies and redefine how individuals and businesses interact with these powerful tools. Alongside my professional work, I am pursuing studies in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, equipping myself to lead innovative and ambitious projects in the future.
